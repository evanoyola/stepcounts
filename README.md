# stepcounts
Simple python code to process csv pedometer data extracted from phones or fitness trackers

The code takes a csv file with the format coming out of an iPhone via using the QS access app. 
The step log is created by date (not by time of day).

Data for individual years is created by hand, not automatically.

Plotting details are modified by hand for each individual user case.
